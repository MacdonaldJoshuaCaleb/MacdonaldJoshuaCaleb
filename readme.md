Hi there, I'm Josh.  I am a quantitative researcher with extensive experience in dynamic modeling, simulation-based parameter estimation, and Bayesian inference. I have led projects in infectious disease dynamics and ecosystem modeling, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to provide robust data-driven insights. 

# Core Skills 
## Mathematical & Statistical Modeling
Develop data-driven dynamic and statistical models using nonlinear differential equations and multivariate statistics. Sensitivity & Identifiability analyses, paired with simulation-based parameter estimation techniques.
## Bayesian Inference & Machine Learning
Apply variational Bayesian methods, sequential hypothesis testing, and neural posterior estimation to achieve robust parameter inference.
## Data Analysis & Programming
Proficient in Python, R, \& MATLAB; experienced in data imputation, clustering, and simulation-based inference.
## Communication & Collaboration 
Present complex modeling outcomes through technical reports and seminars to interdisciplinary teams and public health agencies. Work collaboratively with experts across public health, oceanography, and cultural studies to address multifaceted challenges.
