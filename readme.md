Hi there, I'm Josh.  I am a quantitative researcher with extensive experience in dynamic modeling, simulation-based parameter estimation, and Bayesian inference. I have led projects in infectious disease dynamics and ecosystem modeling, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to provide robust data-driven insights.
