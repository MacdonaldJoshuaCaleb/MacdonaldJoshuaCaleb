Hi there, I'm Josh.  I am a quantitative researcher with extensive experience in dynamic modeling, simulation-based parameter estimation, and Bayesian inference. I have led projects in infectious disease dynamics and ecosystem modeling, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to provide robust data-driven insights. 

# Core Skills 
## Mathematical & Statistical Modeling
Develop data-driven dynamic and statistical models using nonlinear differential equations and multivariate statistics. Sensitivity & Identifiability analyses, paired with simulation-based parameter estimation techniques.
## Bayesian Inference & Machine Learning
Apply variational Bayesian methods, sequential hypothesis testing, and neural posterior estimation to achieve robust parameter inference.
## Data Analysis & Programming
Proficient in Python, R, \& MATLAB; experienced in data imputation, clustering, and simulation-based inference.
## Communication & Collaboration 
Present complex modeling outcomes through technical reports and seminars to interdisciplinary teams and public health agencies. Work collaboratively with experts across public health, oceanography, and cultural studies to address multifaceted challenges.

# Projects
## Influenza Scenario Modeling 
Led Johns Hopkins contributions to the influenza scenario modelinghub.  Implmeneted and calibrated influenza models for all 50 US states and wahsingtion D.C. using FlepiMoP and hierarchical Bayesian inference.  
## Cultral Evolution in Austronesia 
Employed a Bayesian PCA framework with sequential hypothesis testing to objectively determine significant dimensions in high-dimensional cultural datasets, facilitating reconstruction of cultural transmission networks among Austronesian-speaking peoples.

## FMDV Transmission Dynamics
Formulated within-host models linking viral replication and immune responses to predict FMDV transmission dynamics in African buffalo. Simulation-based identifiability techniques ensured robust parameter estimation. 
(See: Macdonald et al., [2024d](https://doi.org/10.1086/730703))
## Aquatic Ecosystem Analysis
Extended classical Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) models by incorporating non-trophic interactions, applying bifurcation analysis to identify critical thresholds for harmful algal blooms. 
(See: Macdonald & Gulbudak, [2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-023-01969-7))
## COVID-19 Outbreak Modeling
Developed dynamic epidemic models integrating testing-dependent ascertainment rates to estimate key parameters such as lockdown initiation and relaxation rates. These models revealed an inverse relationship between outbreak size and safety measure adherence turnover rate. (See: Browne, Gulbudak, & Macdonald, [2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110919); Macdonald, Browne, & Gulbudak, [2021](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210227).)
